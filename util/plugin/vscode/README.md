# Mettle Language for VS Code

Basic language support for `.mettle` source files.

## Available editor features

- `.mettle` file recognition;
- TextMate syntax highlighting for supported Mettle constructs, including loops, conditional and boolean operators, numeric bases, exponents, and fractional durations;
- `//` comment toggling;
- matching and automatic closing of braces, brackets, parentheses, and strings;
- indentation and region folding;
- snippets for named flows, anonymous flows, tests, namespaces, assertions, terminal `fail()`,
  reusable and anonymous file contexts, `senv()`, `echo()`, conditionals, assertion messages, loops, named parallel branches, structured and load execution
  policies, and HTTP requests using named `body`;
- snippets for complete filesystem reads, incremental copies, streamed HTTP downloads/uploads, and lazy `source`/`yield` producers;
- `use codec name { ... }` snippets for declaration and file-level registration, plus bounded `framing` snippets (delimited, length-prefixed, custom) and a frame loop;
- highlighting and compiler-backed references for `source`, `yield`, and loop `break`;
- highlighting for built-in `is`/`as` kind operations and snippets for codecs/media types;
- compiler-backed **Run Flow** CodeLens actions above every named and anonymous flow;
- **Run Test** play buttons above each test declaration; each runs only that test;
- parser and compiler diagnostics in the editor, including unsaved project files;
- a file-level **Run All Eligible Flows** command for zero-argument flows;
- a file-level **Run Tests in File** command;
- a status-bar profile picker for `.env` and `.env.<name>` files;
- prompts for named flow parameters and execution in a dedicated task terminal.
- Ctrl+Click, **Go to Definition**, and **Peek Definition** for flow calls,
  context uses, parameters, and local bindings, including declarations in other
  project files and references in unsaved editor text.
- hover descriptions for keywords, core helpers, primitive kinds, built-in
  capabilities, operations, named/nested options, constants, and documented
  user flows/parameters/contexts;
- inferred native kinds and known fields for bindings, aliases, context values,
  parameters, reusable flow results, and field accesses;
- signature help while typing positional or named arguments, including incomplete calls;
- read-only offline references through F12 or the hover's **Open full reference** link.

The extension contains a small JavaScript entry point using only VS Code and Node built-in APIs. It has no npm runtime dependencies. Mettle discovery comes from project-aware `mettle list <file> --json`. Navigation, diagnostics, hover, and signature help use the Language Server Protocol through `mettle lsp`; they reuse the Rust parser, compiler, project discovery, source spans, and namespace resolver, so the editor does not maintain a second language implementation. Built-in documentation comes from Rust capability descriptors and syntax/compiler inventories, not a JavaScript catalogue. Diagnostics refresh as open files change, when files are saved, and when project files change on disk. Completion, find references, rename, formatting, and semantic highlighting remain planned.

## Navigate source

Hold Ctrl and click a flow call, a name in `use context`, or a local name to
open its declaration. The usual **Go to Definition** (`F12`) and **Peek
Definition** (`Alt+F12`) commands work as well. Cross-file lookup follows the
same implicit-global, current-namespace, and `use namespace` rules as the
compiler. Ambiguous and unresolved names deliberately have no destination.

**Go to Implementation** opens the declaration of a named flow call or local
binding reference. Parameters and named contexts use Go to Definition.

The extension starts `mettle lsp` in the background and synchronizes complete
in-memory documents, so a file does not need to be saved before navigation.

## Code documentation

Hover `http.post`, `body:`, `tls.verifyCertificates`, `fs.read`, or
`json.mediaType` to see the relevant description. Every reserved word (including
`assert`, `use`, and `parallel`) also has a hover and full reference. Core helpers
`env`, `senv`, `secret`, and `echo` have argument descriptions; primitive kinds
such as `integer` are documented when used with `is` or `as`. While entering a
call, signature help shows argument descriptions and selects the current named
argument. Use **Trigger Parameter Hints** (`Ctrl+Shift+Space`) to reopen it.
Operation hovers show a compact signature, practical behavior notes, and a small
example. The `…` in a hover signature stands for optional named options; signature
help and the full reference retain the complete option list. HTTP descriptions
explain request-body encoding and distinguish error status codes from call failures;
filesystem and codec descriptions explain buffering, consumption, and decoding rules.
`text.split`, `text.find`, `text.findAll`, `text.matches`, and `text.replace` include
selector and bound descriptions. Match fields come from the same Rust record that
constructs runtime results. HTTP `stream`/`maxCaptureBytes` and streamed response
`chunks`/`close` are documented in the registered schema, not in editor-only data.
Declared codecs have Go to Definition from `use codec name` (including the
combined `use codec name { ... }` declaration) and
`name.mediaType`, plus a hover showing the canonical media type, aliases, and
file-level activation rule. Codec method bodies still use ordinary native-value
hovers. Registered codecs can also be called directly as `name.encode(value)`
and `name.decode(bytes)` for complete values; no separate editor codec registry
is maintained.
Declared framings have Go to Definition, hover, and parameter hints for
`name.frames(bytesOrSource)` and `name.encode(frame)`. Hovers on built-in
framings, their arguments and length prefixes, and on `input.readUntil` /
`input.readExactly` in a custom `read` method come from the same reference as
`mettle docs framing`. The keyword, declaration name, and built-in framings are
highlighted by the packaged TextMate grammar.

HTTP response references describe decoded native `.body` values and normalized
`.mediaType`; `.bodyBytes` retains the representation bytes. The old response
`.json` field is removed. Proven HTTP-result accesses receive compiler migration
diagnostics directing callers to `.body`. Hover a binding such as
`created = http.post(...)`, an alias, or `created.status` for its inferred native
kind and known response fields. Shapes and field descriptions come from the
compiler and the same result records used by the runtime, not an editor catalogue.
JSON is not a native value kind: `.body` remains runtime-dependent, and arbitrary
payload fields are not guessed. Flow parameters are caller-dependent; a reusable
helper's result is inferred without specializing it for one caller.

Ordinary object literals, finite array elements, named parallel branches, and
policy-block results also retain known information where sound. Branch results
keep only common fields. Analysis is bounded; large shapes are previewed and
complex or invalid expressions may remain unknown. Complete statements can
retain hovers while a later statement is unfinished. No requests are executed,
files opened as runtime sources, or environment values read to answer a hover.
Statically sensitive values are marked without displaying contents; other
runtime sensitivity is not guessed. Try the offline
[variable intelligence example](../../../examples/language/variable-intelligence.mettle).

F12, Ctrl+Click, or **Open full reference** in a built-in hover opens a read-only
Markdown document with the signature, arguments, options, defaults, result
fields, behavior, and an example. References are generated by the running CLI
from the same capability schemas used for validation and shared runtime defaults,
or the syntax/compiler inventories that own keyword and core-helper names.
They are version-matched and offline; opening documentation never performs I/O
operations. Other LSP clients can use the standard hover and signature-help
requests; virtual references require a client adapter.

Attach documentation to your own flow or named context with contiguous `///`
comments immediately above its declaration:

```mettle
/// Build a friendly greeting.
/// @param name Name to include in the greeting.
/// @returns The greeting as a string.
flow greet(name) = "Hello, ${name}!"
```

Descriptions support Markdown. Blank physical lines or ordinary `//` comments
detach the documentation block; use `///` for paragraph breaks within it.
`@param` names are checked against the declaration, and unknown/duplicate names
produce editor warnings without changing execution. The same descriptions work
across namespaces/project files and unsaved edits. Try the network-free
[documentation example](../../../examples/language/documentation.mettle).

For the same reference in a terminal, run `mettle docs http.post` (or `fs.read`,
`json.encode`, `text.mediaType`, `assert`, `use`, or the `language` index). Use
`language.bytes` for the primitive-kind reference rather than the `bytes` codec.
After rebuilding the CLI or installing a new extension package, reload the VS Code
window to restart its language server.

## Run flows

The Mettle CLI must be available on `PATH`. From the repository root:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/mettle-cli --locked
```

Set **Mettle: Executable Path** when the binary lives elsewhere.

Open a `.mettle` file and use the action shown above any declaration:

```text
▶ Run GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
http.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")

▶ Run inspectRequest
flow inspectRequest(baseUrl, requestId) =
    http.get("${baseUrl}/posts/${requestId}")
```

The extension asks for `baseUrl` and `requestId` before launching `inspectRequest`. Use `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com` as the base URL for the included demo. Anonymous flows are selected by their compiler-reported identity; named flows are selected by name. Dirty files are saved before execution. The dedicated task terminal shows the same structured flow report and live workload dashboard as the CLI. Use `mettle run --verbose` to expand HTTP response headers and decoded bodies.

To run every zero-argument flow in the active file, use **Mettle: Run All Eligible Flows in File** from the Command Palette or the editor title bar. Parameterized flows are skipped; the terminal ends with a batch summary. Project batches use `[run].jobs` from the nearest `mettle.toml`, defaulting to one job when omitted.

To run tests declared in the active file, use **Mettle: Run Tests in File**.
This action honors `[test].jobs` in `mettle.toml`; selecting an individual test
still runs only that test. For example, `[test]` followed by `jobs = 4` enables
up to four concurrent tests in the file without extra editor configuration.
With a `.mettle` file open, click **Mettle profile: Default** (or the current
profile name) in the bottom status bar, click the gear icon in the editor title
bar, or run **Mettle: Select Profile** from the Command Palette to choose
`qa`, `prod`, or another profile discovered beside the file or at its
project root. With `.env` and `.env.qa`, the picker shows **Default** and **qa**.
**Default** uses `.env` without passing `--profile`. The selection is remembered
per project (or per standalone-file directory) and
is passed to Run Flow, Run All, and Run Tests. The picker refreshes when the
active file changes, the window gains focus, or env files are created, deleted,
or renamed. If a selected profile disappears, the status bar warns rather than
silently switching environments.

Filesystem paths in standalone executions start at the active file's containing
directory, which is the task's CLI invocation directory. If the file belongs to
a Mettle project, the CLI uses the project root or its top-level `workingDir`
setting instead. Helper flows use the same directory. This does not change the
profile picker's environment discovery. File reads/writes and `body: fs.stream`
uploads use the ordinary flow actions; no exchange UI is required.

## Package

From this directory:

```bash
npm run package
```

Packaging uses the pinned official Microsoft `@vscode/vsce` 4.0.0 tool. It is downloaded by `npx` and is not included in the installed extension.

The resulting package is:

```text
dist/mettle-language-1.0.0-alpha.3.vsix
```

## Install

Install or update from the command line:

```bash
code --install-extension dist/mettle-language-1.0.0-alpha.3.vsix --force
```

Alternatively, open the Extensions view, choose **Install from VSIX…**, and select the package from `dist/`.

Open any `.mettle` file after installation. VS Code should show `Mettle` as the language mode in the status bar. Reload the editor window if an already-open file does not update immediately.
When changing the grammar in this repository, package and reinstall the VSIX
before reloading the window. Reloading alone still uses the previously installed
grammar, even when the source file in this checkout has changed.

## Development

Open this extension directory in VS Code and press `F5` to launch an Extension Development Host. The extension is plain JavaScript and needs no compilation step.

Inspect highlighting scopes with **Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes** from the Command Palette.

The current snippets prefer `flow main { ... }`, `test "name" { ... }`, and
`http.post("/path", body: { ... })`. Existing parenthesized declarations and
legacy HTTP option blocks remain accepted by the CLI.
