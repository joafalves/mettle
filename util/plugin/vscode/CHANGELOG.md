# Change Log

## Unreleased

- Offer an inline `use codec name { ... }` snippet that declares and registers
  a codec in one step, with matching hover, navigation, and highlighting.
- Highlight `framing` declarations, built-in `delimited`, `lengthPrefixed`, and
  `fixed` framings, and custom read/write methods; `framing` stays an ordinary
  name elsewhere. Replace the incremental codec snippet with delimited,
  length-prefixed, custom-framing, and frame-loop snippets.
- Navigate to declared framings and to codecs named by a framing `mediaType`;
  show hover and signature help for `name.frames(source)`, `name.encode(frame)`,
  built-in framing arguments and length prefixes, and `input.readUntil` /
  `input.readExactly` in custom read methods.

## 1.0.0-alpha.1

- Add `codec`/`use codec` highlighting and a declaration snippet; the language
  server resolves custom media-type constants, definitions, and registration
  hovers from the Rust compiler and syntax trees.
- Add a single-`decode` incremental codec snippet using `stream`/`yield`, with
  source-backed value-stream highlighting and compiler/LSP diagnostics.

- Add `source`/`yield` and `break` highlighting/snippets, a streamed-download
  snippet, and schema-backed hovers for bounded text/regex and live HTTP fields.

- Add compiler-backed binding/field hovers with native kinds, known shapes,
  helper/alias propagation, context values, and safe sensitivity metadata.

- Normalize incoming HTTP bodies into native values and expose `mediaType`;
  replace response `.json` with `.body`, with compiler migration diagnostics.
- Document every reserved word, core helpers, and contextual primitive kinds on
  hover and in offline references; add argument hints for checks and policies.
- Keep operation hovers compact, with practical HTTP/filesystem/codec descriptions
  and examples; retain exhaustive options in signature help and full references.
- Add schema-backed hover, named-argument signature help, and read-only offline
  references for built-in capabilities through F12 or a hover link.
- Support user `///` documentation with `@param`/`@returns`, cross-file and unsaved
  documentation lookup, and nonblocking warnings for mismatched parameter tags.
- Add documentation highlighting and the `flowdoc` snippet.
- Align the extension's pre-release version with the Mettle workspace.
- Add file contexts, profiles, tests, conditionals, terminal `fail()`, load
  workloads, structured HTTP output, and richer execution diagnostics.
- Add Go to Implementation for named flow calls and local binding references. Parameters and named contexts remain available through Go to Definition.

## 0.16.0

- Add an `echo()` snippet for flow-scoped diagnostic messages.
- Show logical parallel-branch and retry-attempt labels in the CLI report.

## 0.15.0

- Support selecting one test by name or source line with `mettle test`.

## 0.12.0

  unsaved project files, and clear stale diagnostics after fixes or closing files.

- Discover `.env` profiles for standalone files and projects in a status-bar picker.
- Pass the selected profile to Run Flow, Run All, and Run Tests tasks.
- Add a file-level Run Tests command.

  status-bar selection explicitly.
- Add snippets for file tests, anonymous file contexts, and `senv()`.

## 0.7.0

- Rename the extension, language mode, CLI configuration, and VSIX package to Mettle.
- Continue to use `flow` as the language keyword for reusable workflows.

## 0.6.1

- Keep anonymous Run Flow actions valid when their request text changes.
- Refresh Run Flow CodeLens actions after saving a `.mettle` file.
