# Agent instructions for Mettle

These instructions apply throughout this repository. Read
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the shared contribution workflow and commit
conventions.

## Project context and sources of truth

Mettle is an experimental I/O-oriented language and native Rust runtime for
protocol workflows, functional checks, and load tests. HTTP is the implemented
protocol capability. SIP, distributed workers, native-code generation, and
external binary plugins are future work; do not assume they exist.

- Use the implementation, tests, and checked-in configuration to establish current
  behavior. [README.md](README.md) is the current user-facing overview; verify it
  against the code when changing behavior.
- This file and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) record working conventions.
- Files under `docs/` are temporary supporting material, including design proposals
  and implementation notes. They may be stale; consult them for context rather
  than treating them as a live specification or mandatory reading.
- Use Cargo manifests, `Cargo.lock`, and `scripts/check-licenses.py` for the current
  dependency graph and licence checks.
- Read the relevant editor README before changing a plugin under `util/plugin/`.

Maintained documentation on GitHub, potentially a wiki, is planned for beta.
Until it exists, keep the README and examples aligned with behavior without
requiring every historical design note to be maintained.

Keep protocol behavior behind capability interfaces. The parser handles general
language syntax; the compiler validates capability descriptors without depending
on the HTTP client. The runtime executes resolved plans rather than reparsing or
resolving source during execution. Editor intelligence reuses the compiler and LSP.
Keep larger crates organized into focused modules rather than growing `lib.rs`
indefinitely.

## Implementation rules

- Use the Rust toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (currently 1.98.1), Rust
  edition 2024, and workspace lint settings. `unsafe` code is forbidden.
- Support Linux x64, Windows x64, and Apple Silicon macOS. Intel macOS is not a
  supported target. Keep platform-specific code isolated with portable behavior.
- Preserve structured concurrency: work has an owner, cancellation propagates,
  cleanup is bounded, and queues, concurrency, capture, and metrics remain bounded.
  Do not introduce detached runtime work or blocking I/O on async execution paths.
- Keep generated `source`/`yield` production pull-driven and single-consumer; a
  consumer drop, early HTTP response, or entry cancellation must stop its owned
  production work. `break` stays within the nearest collection loop and cannot
  escape a producer or execution-policy boundary.
- Streamed HTTP responses belong to the entry's `IoContext`. Keep `.chunks` raw
  and single-consumer, `.body`/`.bodyBytes` one shared bounded capture, and
  `close()`/entry cleanup prompt and idempotent. Observation, CLI reports, and LSP
  must snapshot metadata without acquiring or retaining live body handles. A
  final execution result cannot contain live responses or sources.
- Plain user codec declarations are inert until explicit file-level `use codec`
  registration; `use codec name { ... }` combines declaration and registration.
  Resolve names and duplicate media claims at compile time; use
  exact normalized media-type matches before generic built-in fallbacks. Keep
  conversion bodies pure, bounded, entry-owned, and source-aware. Encode returns
  bytes; decode receives complete bytes and returns one native value. A named
  `framing` (a contextual keyword) separates complete frames from bytes and
  encodes them back. Its `frames(source)` method is lazy and single-consumer;
  `encode(frame)` uses the selected media-type codec before applying the
  framing. Built-in `delimited`/`lengthPrefixed`/`fixed` framings and custom
  read/write methods must bound each complete encoded frame, including
  prefixes or delimiters; the built-in framing inventory in
  `mettle_compiler::documentation` owns their names and accepted arguments.
  Waiting for bytes is bounded by the source, not by the framing. Never treat
  transport chunks as frames or load executable code named by incoming metadata.
  Preserve project-file isolation, diagnostics, and editor navigation.
- Preserve sensitive-value metadata and redaction through transformations,
  diagnostics, reports, and editor output. Never commit real credentials; checked-in
  environment examples and TLS material are local fixtures only.
- Preserve source spans and useful diagnostics across parsing, compilation,
  execution, and LSP. Keep JSON output parseable and stdout/stderr behavior deliberate.
- Prefer existing infrastructure and explicit dependency features. Update
  `Cargo.lock`, dependency documentation, and the generated licence report when
  dependency changes require them. Do not bypass the licence allowlist to pass CI.
- Keep language changes aligned across the Rust parser/compiler/runtime, TextMate
  grammar and snippets, Tree-sitter grammar/queries, examples, and documentation as
  applicable. Generate Tree-sitter outputs with CLI 0.25.8; do not hand-edit them.
- Keep changes focused. Preserve unrelated local work and avoid speculative
  abstractions, unrelated refactors, or changing semantics merely to silence tests.

## Code documentation and editor references

Documentation is part of a user-facing code change, not a later cleanup task.
When adding or changing a capability, operation, argument, option, constant,
result field, or language behavior, update the applicable in-code documentation,
README, and executable examples in the same changeset.

- Preserve **one source per fact**. Capability schemas own names, signatures,
  accepted types, option conflicts, and result shapes. Descriptions and examples
  are authored beside their capability implementation. Runtime defaults and
  canonical media types must be shared with documentation through constants or
  existing accessors, not copied as independent literals.
- Built-in reference rendering lives in
  `crates/mettle-capability/src/documentation.rs`; the CLI's `mettle docs` command
  and LSP consume that metadata. Keep editor adapters presentation-only: do not
  add a separate JavaScript catalogue of signatures, defaults, or descriptions.
- Core keywords and their lexer spellings share the inventory in
  `crates/mettle-syntax/src/language.rs`; compiler-owned helpers (`env`, `senv`,
  `secret`, and `echo`) share intrinsic resolution and documentation in
  `crates/mettle-compiler/src/documentation.rs`. Primitive-kind references use
  `ValueKind`, not a second type-name list. Extend the owning inventory and its
  coverage tests when adding a keyword, primitive kind, or helper. Keyword hovers
  must use source tokens, never match words inside comments or string literals.
- Write descriptions that explain behavior rather than merely restating a name
  (for example, "Send a payload with HTTP POST" is insufficient on its own).
  Cover meaningful accepted inputs/representations, returned values, errors and
  status handling, side effects, and relevant bounds, cancellation, or source
  ownership. Distinguish current behavior from proposed features.
- Keep hover content useful and scannable. Lead with purpose and important
  behavior; put exhaustive options and longer explanations in the full reference.
  Describe each argument/option and nested schema field, including units and
  conditional defaults where applicable. Include a small valid example using
  local fixtures and no real credentials; avoid repeating shared prose across
  operations when a common source can own it.
- Document reusable user-facing example flows and named contexts with contiguous
  `///` comments immediately above the declaration. Use `@param` with actual
  declared parameter names and `@returns` where helpful. These comments describe
  behavior; they do not introduce runtime annotations or a second type system.
- Add regression coverage for metadata and affected consumers. Check generated
  references with `mettle docs <symbol>` and exercise relevant hover/signature-help
  tests, including incomplete calls, named arguments, source spans, and unsaved
  cross-file lookup when applicable. Verify examples still parse and compile.
  Inspect actual output before declaring presentation work complete; distinguish
  automated checks from any editor UI checks actually performed.
- For removed capability-result fields, put migration messages in the capability
  descriptor's `removed_result_fields`. Compiler diagnostics and generated
  references reuse this metadata. Do not hard-code protocol names in the compiler
  or reject ordinary payload fields when their result provenance is unknown.
- Declare capability result objects with `mettle_capability::result_object!`,
  which generates runtime field keys and documented schemas from one record.
  Supply every record field when constructing a result; update descriptions and
  regression tests alongside behavior changes instead of adding a hover catalogue.
- Keep variable/field intelligence in `mettle_compiler::semantics`, over resolved
  compiler plans and lexer spans. Do not add protocol-specific inference to LSP
  or JavaScript. Preserve native kinds, conservative unknowns, bounded shape
  analysis, caller-independent helper results, scopes, and unsaved project input.
  Never evaluate I/O, read environment values, or include bound contents in hovers.
  Distinguish sensitive wrappers from objects merely containing sensitive fields.

After Rust changes, rebuild the CLI. For the local installed-binary workflow,
reinstall with `cargo install --path crates/mettle-cli --locked` so CLI/editor
behavior reflects the changes. Package/update the extension when its code changes,
and tell the user when a VS Code window reload is needed to restart its LSP.

## Verification and delivery

For code changes, run the relevant tests first, then the applicable CI checks
listed in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#validation). Add regression coverage for
changed behavior or important invariants. Use local fixtures, fake capabilities,
injectable clocks, and synchronization instead of public services or fragile
sleep-based ordering assertions.

For documentation-only changes, verify accuracy, links, and `git diff --check`;
runtime tests are unnecessary unless executable behavior also changed. Report
what changed, checks actually run, and any checks that could not be completed.
Do not claim a CI run passed based only on local checks.

All new commits must use Conventional Commits:
`<type>[optional scope][!]: <description>`. This includes commits created by
agents. Use a concise imperative description, a relevant type such as `feat`,
`fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, or `revert`, and
`!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for breaking changes. Examples:

```text
feat(runtime): add bounded batch execution
fix(cli): redact sensitive assertion messages
ci: remove macOS Intel coverage
docs: document contribution and agent conventions
```

Follow the user's requested Git workflow; do not rewrite existing history to
convert older commit messages to this convention.
